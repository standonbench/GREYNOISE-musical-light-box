A physical computing project done with Kat Zhang, using Arduino with the aim to give the user the ability to draw music.
The centre block encases a light sensor that reads the paper strip which has been drawn on.  Each scale of grey corresponds to a note on the C-Major blue scale. The tape system is actuated by a hidden DC motor, which depending on its turning speed, changes the tempo of the coloured in melody.

Box design, build and renders made by Kat Zhang. Code written and wiring done by Pierre.
