A physical computing project done with Kat Zhang, using Arduino with the aim to give the user the ability to draw music.
The centre block encases a light sensor that reads the paper strip which has been drawn on.  Each scale of grey corresponds to a note on the C-Major blue scale. The tape system is actuated by a hidden DC motor, which depending on its turning speed, changes the tempo of the coloured in melody.
